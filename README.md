### Difficulty level: intermediate.

## Your Task

As a Shakespeare buff, statistics junkie, and unix lover, Ben finds himself wanting a command-line tool for analyzing Macbeth.

Write a command-line program that prints the number of lines spoken by each character in the play.

Sample usage/output (using made-up numbers):

    $ ruby macbeth_analyzer.rb
      543 Macbeth
      345 Banquo
      220 Duncan
      (etc.)

You can find an XML-encoded version of Macbeth here: http://www.ibiblio.org/xml/examples/shakespeare/macbeth.xml. Your program should download and parse this file at runtime.

Your solution must be tested, preferably via TDD.

## Working/Submitting

1. To work on this exercise, fork the repo and begin implementing your solution.
2. When you are done, copy the output of your program into a file in this repository. 
3. Create a pull request so your code can be reviewed.
4. Perform a code review on at least one other person's solution. Your comments should follow our code review guidelines: https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/code-review. Most important: be friendly. Make suggestions, not demands. 
5. Improve your solution based on the comments you've received and approaches you've learned from reviewing others' attempts.

## Bounty

While knowledge and skill improvement are their own rewards, the author with the best solution (as judged by thoughtbot) will receive a cool thoughtbot t-shirt.
